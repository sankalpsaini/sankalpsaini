## Hello hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sankalp and this is my personal Github! Thanks for visiting! I am a soon-to-be graduate from the University of Alberta in Computer Science and I am looking for some opportunities in 2024! I am experienced in full-stack development and am very interested in development, cybersecurity, and machine learning roles. Some more information about me:

- ðŸŒ± I will be graduating in April of 2024 with a large portion of my last year CMPUT classes being dedicated to Machine Learning. In addition to that, I will be honing my skills in C+, React.js, SQL, and Python.
- ðŸ”­ In addition to school projects, Iâ€™m currently working as the tech lead on a startup designed to allow users to invest using specific algorithms with little to no experience.
- ðŸ’¬ Make sure to ask me about ConnecTech. A virtual platform founded by myself to help Computer Science students learn more about local events, hackathons, conferences, resources, etc. to help them make the most out of their university careers!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: visit www.sankalpsaini.com and email me from there!
- âš¡ Fun fact! I just went skydiving recently and you could not get me to shut-up about that experience!

###  Thanks for visiting my page!
